# Outlook
Script that moves emails that meet a certain criteria to a different folder to keep organisation

I created and used this in my workplace to save myself time from dragging emails manually to keep the shared inbox clutter free from automatic response emails.

This script uses outlook's API to access the emails and then moves them in their relevant folder so they are still tracked but do not clutter up the main inbox
